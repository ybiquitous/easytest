# Easytest

> makes you write tests easily

Easytest is a tiny testing framework for Ruby with a familiar DSL.

## Installation

Add this line to your `Gemfile` for Bundler:

```ruby
gem "easytest"
```

Or install it via `gem`:

```shell
gem install easytest
```

## Documentation

You can read more about Easytest on the [official website](https://ybiquitous.github.io/easytest/).

## Usage

Here is a very easy example.

First, put `test/addition_test.rb` as below:

```ruby
require "easytest"

using Easytest::DSL

test "addition" do
  expect(1 + 2).to_eq 2
end
```

Then, run `easytest`:

```console
$ easytest
 FAIL  test/addition_test.rb
  âœ• addition  (should equal)

    Expected: 2
    Received: 3

    # test/addition_test.rb:6:in `block in <top (required)>'


 Tests:  1 failed, 0 passed, 1 total (1 files)
 Time:   0.00087 seconds
```

Oops. Let's fix the failure:

```diff
- expect(1 + 2).to_eq 2
+ expect(1 + 2).to_eq 3
```

Then, run it again:

```console
$ easytest
 PASS  test/addition_test.rb

 Tests:  1 passed, 1 total (1 files)
 Time:   0.00077 seconds
```

The test now passes! ðŸŽ‰

### Hooks

You can add hooks called `before` and `after` to each test case:

```ruby
before do
  # set up something...
end

after do
  # clean up something...
end

test "something" do
  # test something...
end
```

### Skip

If you want to skip any cases, you can change `test` to `skip`:

```diff
- test "addition" do
+ skip "addition" do
```

Skipped cases will be reported as "skipped".

### Only

If you want to run only any cases, you can use `test` to `only`:

```diff
- test "addition" do
+ only "addition" do
```

Only cases with `only` will be run, and other cases will be skipped.

### To-do

If you want to write to-do cases, you can use `test` without a block:

```ruby
test "addition"
```

To-do cases will be reported as "todo".
